# Introduction
 . Autonomous recommender systems are the systems that help users find and select interest items. One of the main strategies to make identification of user interests in a news portal is the read news content.  This project offers a personalized news recommender system in which user interests can be predicted based on the contents of news read by their users, extracting keywords, and finding semantic relations between them. One of the topic modeling algorithms is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which scores terms based on repetition of terms. Deep neural networks have a great success in many NLP tasks, which are based on RNN, CNN, LSTM, and recently attention mechanisms inspired by neuroscience. The experimental work is done in Python language and finally compares six kinds of DNN in the prediction of interest news which proposed a structure that involves CNN to extract local information, an attention layer to extract semantic information from critical words, and LSTM to extract dependencies between words. This proposed DNN possesses a higher F1 measure in comparison with others. The input of DNN is a term-topic matrix and the output is user-topic for each document.
